I am a Troubleshooting guide (TSG). Follow this TSG with required inputs to solve incident.
 
How to Find Charge Difference due to Rerating .Rerating of Rating Period can happen due to multiple reason such as COCP, incorrect meter prices etc. 
When rerating is done with repricing , charges differ before and after rerating becaause prices of meters may change. 
Customers raise CRI to understand what caused charges difference before and after rerating
          
This TSG would help in finding the charges difference between for specific consumptionVersion and ratingperiodId

Use cluster as http://localhost:9000 and database as NetDefaultDB

Step 1. Find the Consumption Version during Month Close.

Get the RatingPeriodId and SQLizerStreamDateId value to run following query to obtain consumpation version. 
In below Example we used month close data of 03 March 23 Hours for Feb Month Rating Period.

cluster('<Replace with cluster>').database('<Replace with database>').RatingPeriodCumulativeConsumption 
| where SQLizerStreamDateId >= datetime(<Replace with datetime value>) //Example 2025-03-03 23:00:00.0000000
| where RatingPeriodId == '<Replace with RatingPeriodId>' 
| summarize arg_max(ConsumptionVersion,*) by RatingPeriodId


Step 2. Calculate charge based on above Consumption Version and RatingPeriodId

Take RatingPeriodId and ConsumptionVersion and run the following query to get the charges

cluster('<Cluster Name>').database('<Database name>').RatingPeriodCumulativeConsumptionInstruction
| where ConsumptionVersion in ('<ConsumptionVersion>')
| where RatingPeriodId == '<Replace with RatingPeriodId>'
| extend TotalUnits = (BillableUnits + UnbillableUnits) 
| summarize RPCCI_TotalUnits = sum(TotalUnits), RPCCI_BillableUnits = sum(BillableUnits), RPCCI_UnbillableUnits = sum(UnbillableUnits) 
    by RatingPeriodId, ConsumptionVersion
